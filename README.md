The aim of this application is to provide people with an extensive hybrid social media platform that not only provide with fun but also integrate issues which work in parallel to the Posts. 
Users of this application can post random stuff, if they have issues in their locality or have any issue such as low self esteem they can create a private issue which will notify only those experts associated with dealing such issues.
Organizations such as NGOs and Goverment Organization can also sign in with a valid google account and serious issues in the surrounding regions such as rape threats, acid attacks can be recorded via application.
